## What is Intelar?

The public landing page at `/` introduces research, learning, and collaboration. Open `/chat` for a new conversation; saved conversations remain at `/c/[id]`. Sign-in returns to `/chat` by default, and sign-out returns to the landing page.

The landing-page header includes a light/dark switch that shares the app's saved theme preference. Product previews are illustrative; visitors can pause their animation, and reduced-motion preferences disable it.

Intelar is an AI-powered research assistant you can chat with. Unlike a standard chatbot, Intelar can:

- 🔎 **Search the web** in real time and cite its sources
- 📄 **Read your files** — upload a PDF, CSV, Word doc, or text file and ask questions about it
- 🧠 **Run deep research** — automatically breaks complex questions into sub-queries, fetches full pages, ranks sources by credibility, and synthesises a structured answer with inline citations
- 💬 **Remember your conversation** — persistent multi-turn memory across sessions
- 🔒 **Secure by default** — Google & GitHub login via NextAuth

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.13+
- A Supabase project with Realtime enabled for workspace chat
- Accounts (all have free tiers): [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai), [Pinecone](https://pinecone.io), [Turso](https://turso.tech), [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com), [Tavily](https://tavily.com)
- Google and/or GitHub OAuth app credentials

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daviddozie/intelar.git
cd intelar
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

Copy the example file and fill in your keys:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

| Variable | Where to get it |
|---|---|
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys) |
| `TAVILY_API_KEY` | [tavily.com](https://tavily.com) |
| `PINECONE_API_KEY` | [app.pinecone.io](https://app.pinecone.io) |
| `PINECONE_INDEX` | Your index name in Pinecone (e.g. `intelar`) |
| `PINECONE_HOST` | Your index host URL from the Pinecone dashboard |
| `TURSO_DATABASE_URL` | `libsql://your-db.turso.io` |
| `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN` | From your Turso dashboard |
| `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` | [cloudinary.com/console](https://cloudinary.com/console) |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` | Cloudinary dashboard |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` | Cloudinary dashboard |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | Run `openssl rand -base64 32` |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | `http://localhost:3000` (dev) or your production URL |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com) |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Google Cloud Console |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` | [github.com/settings/developers](https://github.com/settings/developers) |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` | GitHub Developer Settings |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase project URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Supabase publishable API key; safe for browser use |
| `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` | Supabase secret API key; server only |
| `SUPABASE_REALTIME_JWT_KID` | `kid` of the ES256 signing key registered under Supabase Auth → JWT Signing Keys |
| `SUPABASE_REALTIME_JWT_PRIVATE_JWK` | Private ES256 JWK used by Next.js to issue five-minute workspace-scoped tokens; server only |

### 4. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

Workspace chat uses Supabase Realtime and does not need a separate socket process or Redis. Set the Supabase variables in `.env.local`. Get the URL and publishable/secret API keys from the Supabase project dashboard. Generate an ES256 signing key with `supabase gen signing-key --algorithm ES256`, register the matching public JWK in Supabase Auth → JWT Signing Keys, activate it, then configure the key `kid` and private JWK on the server. Keep the secret API key and private JWK out of browser variables and source control. Apply `supabase/migrations/20260929000000_workspace_realtime.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor; it authorizes private workspace message, ephemeral, and per-user read-cursor channels using short-lived member-scoped JWT claims. The app continues to store chat messages and unread read-cursors in Turso. Run `npm run dev:all` to start Next.js and Mastra Studio.

Workspace Realtime carries saved-message broadcasts, presence, and typing only. The free Supabase tier has finite connection and message quotas; Realtime broadcast fan-out contributes usage per recipient, so monitor Realtime usage as workspaces grow. `@Intelar` replies are generated after the HTTP send response within the Next.js function lifetime; this is not a durable job queue.

### Troubleshooting database connections

Conversations and workspace membership both require Turso. A `ConnectTimeoutError` means the app could not establish a connection to the configured database endpoint. Workspace Realtime tokens also require a membership lookup, so a Turso connection failure can prevent token issuance before Supabase configuration is checked.

Verify that `TURSO_DATABASE_URL` matches `turso db show <database-name> --url`, then check the same hostname over HTTPS with `curl -I --connect-timeout 10 https://<database-host>`. If the connection times out, check your network, VPN, firewall, and the database's availability in Turso. Restart Next.js after changing `.env.local`.

Conversation and workspace list requests return HTTP 503 for database connection failures. Their views show the error with a Retry button and keep any cached entries visible.

## Client Data Architecture

- **TanStack Query** owns authenticated server state for conversations and uploaded resources. Query keys are scoped by user, and cache updates or invalidation follow server mutations.
- **React Context** owns transient UI and in-progress chat state: active conversation, sidebar, theme, guest drafts, and streamed assistant messages.
- **Direct fetch flows** remain for streamed AI responses, multipart uploads, and speech requests because they use response streams or file bodies.
- **Server boundaries** remain Next.js API routes plus `src/lib` persistence/search helpers and Mastra agents/workflows. Client caching does not replace server-side authorization.

## �� How the Research Pipeline Works

When Intelar detects a research-type question, it runs a 5-step Mastra workflow instead of a single agent call:

```
1. Plan        → Break the question into 2–3 focused sub-queries
2. Gather      → Run Tavily search for each sub-query (with rate-limit courtesy delays)
3. Deep-fetch  → Fetch the top 3 URLs in full — strip boilerplate, extract prose
4. Rerank      → Score every source by TF-IDF relevance + domain credibility
5. Synthesise  → Write a structured answer with inline [Title](URL) citations
```

For document questions (e.g. *"list the orders in the file"*), the research workflow is skipped. Intelar answers directly from Pinecone RAG — one LLM call, no web search.

## 📄 Supported File Types

| Type | Extension(s) |
|---|---|
| PDF | `.pdf` |
| Word | `.docx` |
| Spreadsheet | `.csv` |
| Plain text | `.txt`, `.md` |
| Images | `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp` |

Documents are semantically chunked (paragraph → sentence boundaries) and stored in Pinecone. Images are uploaded to Cloudinary and passed directly to the agent.

# Workspaces

Signed-in users can create private workspaces at `/workspaces`. Workspace APIs
authorize every request against the signed-in email's membership. Owners can
invite people by email; invitations expire after seven days and can only be
accepted by signing in with the invited email. Configure `RESEND_API_KEY` and
`RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` to send invitations. If either setting is missing, the
workspace page displays a copyable invitation link instead.

Workspace chat is text-only. Mention `@Intelar` in a message to get an assistant
reply in the shared conversation. Projects and workspace resource records are
scoped to their workspace. Resource files are served through a member-checked
endpoint; the underlying files still use the app's existing storage providers.
Workspace chat uses private Supabase Realtime channels for live delivery,
presence, typing indicators, and in-app message notices. Turso remains the
durable source for messages and per-member unread cursors; there is no periodic
message polling. Video calls and browser push notifications are not included.

### Personal settings

Open Settings from the sidebar account menu, or the guest Settings button. Appearance and motion preferences apply across the app and landing page. Signed-in preferences sync through `/api/settings`; guest preferences stay in the browser. Settings uses an additive `user_settings` table in the existing Turso database and requires no new environment variables. Account details are read-only. Data & storage shows browser study-pack and pending-attempt counts; manage downloads in Learn.
